# TDD Lab - FizzBuzz

> This can be done either as a paired lab, or as a mobbed session.

## Learning Objective

- Practice using Test-Driven Development

## Task

You are being asked to practice TDD to write a function called `fizz_buzz`.

That function will take in an `Integer` and:

- return "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3 (e.g. `fizz_buzz(3) == "Fizz"`)
- return "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5 (e.g. `fizz_buzz(5) == "Buzz"`)
- return "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by 3 **and** 5 (e.g. `fizz_buzz(15) == "FizzBuzz"`)
- return the input as a String otherwise (e.g. `fizz_buzz(7) == "7"` ).

You should start by writing a test first, getting it to pass, and then writing another test, and so on. Remember, when writing tests, to try not to think about how the end code will look like, just what you would expect the function to return for a given input.

### Hints

- Maybe start by writing pseudocode for what the function is expected to do. 
- When writing your first test, try to think about the simplest test you could write to start you off. 


### Refactoring

Once you have all your tests passing, have a look at your solution to see if it can be refactored. Your tests should still pass.
