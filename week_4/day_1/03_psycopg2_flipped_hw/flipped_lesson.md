# Flipped Lesson 

For this homework you will read through the lesson on working with a Python class and a database. Do your best to code along with the lesson whilst trying to understand what is happening and why.

- Follow along with the [Connecting to a database lesson](connecting_to_a_database.md) and read the code along with it to help your understanding.

- As you go through the lesson, note down any questions/observations you have and we'll go through them in the homework review tomorrow.
