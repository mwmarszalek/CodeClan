## Sports Scoring app

Build an app that lets a sports fan keep track of their favourite sports league.

As a huge fan of [your sport], you want to stay up to date with the league. You're interested to see which team leads the table and who won the latest games/matches/fixtures/bouts/â€¦

### MVP:
* The app should allow the user to create, edit and remove teams in the league
* The user should be able to create new games
* There should be a way to display all the games for a team and all the teams involved in a game
* The app should display if a game was won or lost

### Possible Extensions:
* Create a league table to see who is on top of the league
* Add players to teams and let them have game stats (points won, fouls, etc.)
* Anything else you can think of
