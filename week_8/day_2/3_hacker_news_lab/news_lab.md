## Lab - Hacker News Client

Build a filterable front-end for [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). Using the following endpoints, allow the user to view a list of top stories, and filter them by title.

- https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json - Latest Stories
- https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{storyId}.json - Story Detail

This lab is designed to allow you to practice:

- Components, state (`useState`), props and `useEffect`.
- Working with requests using Promise.all
- Working with forms
