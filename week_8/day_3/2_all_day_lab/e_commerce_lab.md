# All Day Lab - E-Commerce Site

Todays lab is intended to consolidate everything we have learned so far in React. We will be looking for an app with multiple components and practice with various hooks (useState & useEffect).

## Brief

A client has approached you to help them build a prototype for their E-Commerce site. They would like to have their items for sale listed on a page and have the ability for a user to add an item to their basket. You can pick the theme for the shop.

## MVP

Your app should be able to: 

- Have a route to display a list of items
- Have a user and allow that user to add items to their basket 
- Add a new route to show the basket

> Note: Next week we will have a backend with a database where we would probably keep our user and shop items and fetch them. For now, just hard code them in state.

## Extensions

- Use styled components 
- Add a checkout component where the user can checkout their items
- Add the ability for the user to add a discount code to update their total in the basket
- See if you can add some tests to your application

### Planning

Remember to plan your application. This is an opportunity to consolidate and even try new things in React. So take time before starting to draw out your component hierarchy. Know where the state is going to live and what your props are going to be passed down.
